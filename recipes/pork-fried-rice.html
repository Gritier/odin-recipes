	<h2>A plate of pork fried rice</h2>
	<p>This pork fried rice recipe is my revised version of another recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and
		it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only
		a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
		<li>1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>
		<li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
		<li>¼ cup chopped carrot</li>
		<li>¼ cup chopped broccoli</li>
		<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
		<li>1 cup cold cooked rice</li>
		<li>¼ cup frozen peas</li>
		<li>1 ½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
		<li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
		<li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add pork, green onion, carrot, and
			broccoli; cook and stir until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork mixture to
			a bowl and return skillet to medium heat</li>
		<li>Stir egg into the skillet and scramble until completely set. Add pork mixture back into the skillet;
			stir in rice, peas, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger. Cook and stir until heated
			through, 7 to 10 minutes. </li>
	</ol>
